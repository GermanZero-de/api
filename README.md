# GermanZero API

An API to access GermanZero.

## What is it for

[GermanZero](https://germanzero.de) uses a handful of tools (like a Chat and a Wiki) which are used by its members to organize themselves. This API allows to add new members to all of these systems and add them to a matching group.

## Current state

Since there will be a big announcement in december, we expect a larger number of people leaving their data on our website. We want to store this data in a first step in our CRM system. CiviCRM is specialized on organizations like GermanZero, and suports memberships, events, donations and so on.

Our focus is therefore on the `POST /contacts` route for now.

Next step will be provide functionality on the website to help users to find the member of the Bundestag from their electoral district.
